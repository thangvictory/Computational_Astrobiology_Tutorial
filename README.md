# Computational_Astrobiology_Tutorial
This github repository is dedicated for own personal tutorial study of the course Computational Astrobiology in University of Belgrade (Serbia), which is a part of the Erasmus Mundus Master program in Astrophysics and Space Science (MASS). 

The Jupyter Notebooks in this repo are mostly copies of the Notebooks written by some other dedicated astrophysicists and the owner of this repo uploaded these files for purpose of his own study and report of the course only.
